# Supervised Autonomy — Authority Model (A0–A4)

Fail-closed primitives for Solar workspaces. Framework reference for multi-user reuse.

**Product boundary:** these primitives are **universal** (`core/`). Solar’s public identity remains an AI operating system for multi-agent workflows; supervised autonomy is governance, not a product rename.

Executable rules live in the workspace root `AGENTS.md` (Supervised autonomy). This document is the design source in `core/`. Instance-specific operating contracts may extend it under `sun/plans/` without becoming a dependency of framework code.

## Authority levels (A0–A4)

| Level | May do without further approval | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| **A0 Observe** | Read authorized context, search, detect risks/dates, answer questions | Mutate data or create commitments |
| **A1 Prepare** | Analyze, prioritize, plan/draft **in-turn only**, simulate, propose | Persist to disk, send, or execute side effects |
| **A2 Execute** | Act only with A2 authority (implicit or formal) | Expand beyond approved object/scope/effect |
| **A3 Delegated** | Execute inside a valid written mandate (limits, expiry, stop, revoke) | Exceed mandate or ignore stop conditions |
| **A4 Escalation** | Analyze/prepare only | Decide or authorize irreversible/sensitive acts |

**A1 ≠ write to disk.** Persisting a file is A2 (unless A2-implicit under an explicit save/create request).

## Gate stack (fixed order)

1. Classify intention (A0–A4).
2. Verify authority (A2-implicit only if allowed; external communicate → A2 formal; A3 mandate; or escalate A4).
3. Apply domain gate if any (e.g. External Communication Gate) — **independent failure**.
4. Execute only if 2 and 3 pass.
5. Verify and record evidence for material acts.

**A2 = permission to act. Domain gate = artifact fitness.** A valid A2 does **not** skip a domain gate.

## A2 implicit vs formal

### A2 implicit

No second “approve?” when **all** hold:

1. The user gives an **explicit** instruction to act on local artifacts/systems (create, edit, save, sync local data) — **not** third-party sends/publishes;
2. destination and effect are clear;
3. act is scoped to the requested object;
4. not A4 / stop conditions;
5. not external communication.

Examples: “save this plan under `sun/plans/…`”; clear `solar-code` local edit (no push); `core/**` scripts under an active workflow.

### A2 formal

Always for third-party communication. Also when:

- analysis/prep proposes crossing into mutation or send;
- destination, scope, system, or effect is missing;
- destination/scope changes or a new material risk appears;
- batch, irreversible, or relatively high-impact acts;
- Solar initiated the act proactively;
- commit, push, tag, release, purchase, or credentials.

**Batch:** one A2 may cover N identical-scope acts if destination, max volume, and criteria are named. Third-party send batches always need A2 formal.

**Default validity:** same conversation session and same object/scope/effect. Cross-channel continuity preserves A2 only if the canonical summary keeps object/scope/effect unchanged.

### Formal approval format

> I will use **[agent/capability]** with **[skills/integrations]** to **[action]** on **[destination]**. Effect: **[result]**; **[risk/reversibility if non-obvious]**. Do you approve?

## Separations (required)

Context ≠ authority. Plan ≠ execution. Draft ≠ send. Capability ≠ permission. Attempt ≠ result. Memory ≠ log. Explicit local mandate may be A2-implicit; external communication and proactive proposals are not.

---

## A3 mandate — minimum schema

Recurring delegated autonomy requires a readable, auditable mandate (typically under `sun/delegations/`). Minimum fields:

```yaml
delegation:
  name: ""
  owner: ""
  objective: ""
  allowed_actions: []
  systems: []
  recipients: []
  excluded_data: []
  limits:
    frequency: ""
    volume: ""
    cost: ""
  approval_exceptions: []
  notify_on: []
  stop_conditions: []
  valid_from: ""
  expires_at: ""
  revoke_with: ""
  evidence_log: ""
```

Required controls: **limits**, **expiry** (`expires_at`), **stop conditions**, **revoke** mechanism. Workspaces may keep mandates in shadow until explicit activation with evidence.

**Enforcement ships with the framework:** `core/skills/solar-router/scripts/delegation_ctl.py` validates mandates, refuses mutating actions while in shadow, reserves volume under lock, records evidence, and requires real shadow evidence plus explicit owner approval to activate. See `core/skills/solar-router/references/a3-mandates.md`. Callers fail closed on non-zero exit.

## Async: prepare ≠ queue

Drafting or preparing an async task is not activation. On non-gateway channels, ask before queueing unless an explicit voice request authorizes bounded local preparation (Voice OS D9). For that exception, the Host binds the original request to its scope, destination and effect; an acknowledgement never creates authority. Ambiguous or external actions still require clarification or formal approval. On gateway channels (e.g. Telegram/n8n), auto-queue may apply only when the draft states **object, scope, and effect**; external sends inside the run still need A2 formal + domain gate.

---

## Continuity (high level)

- Prefer one canonical intention across channels; do not fork duplicate tasks for the same goal.
- Machine tasks, human attention surfaces, and channel summaries are federated state — not substitutes for MEMORY.
- Cross-channel continuity may carry A2 only if object/scope/effect are unchanged in the canonical summary.
- Before creating a task, event, message, or artifact, check for duplicates (exists / in progress / closed / same goal rephrased).
